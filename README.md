# Code Organization Guide

This guide outlines practices to improve the efficiency and organization of your code for CMS data analysis. 

* Remember that your code will be viewed by someone else.
* Document early and often along the way. This will not only make your code more readable for others, but also increase your efficiency as you analyze the data.

## Managing Large Datasets with Parallel Processing 

We use [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) for parallel processing in Python. Learn more about [Dask Best Practices](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/best-practices.html). 


## Writing Clean Code


## Cataloging Code

Store each project under your user folder within your DUA folder in cms-share. **Remember that if you are working under multiple data use agreements, you must store your scripts, analytical datasets, and output in the correct DUA folder.** 

Within each project folder, create folders for code, data, and output. For example: 

  ~/cms-share/duas/dua56930/Nadia/OUD_codes
                                        code 
  


## Publishing Code

Publish completed code at github.com/konetzka-lab under a new repository.
